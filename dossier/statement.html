                motivated by my inner child's desire to grow alongside others in a perpetually expanding world, i create digital art exhibits that hold space for change.
                this involves using sound, pixels, space, code, and emerging modes of communication to produce mostly <a href="https://www.nga.gov/research/curatorial-departments/time-based-media-art.html">time-based media</a> and build <a href="https://adepratt.weebly.com/uploads/3/7/7/1/37716215/socially_engaged_art.pdf#page=17">participatory structures</a> for cultural production.
                thereby, my work demonstrates that truth is a social phenomenon shaped by the exercise of agency within definite material circumstances.
                perceptually, there is significant overlap between the heavily layered, atmospheric, experimental arrangements i compose and their antecedents in the <a href="https://repository.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu%3A168948">industrial genre</a>, <a href="https://profiles.shsu.edu/lis_fwh/book/hybrid_children_of_rock/Psychedelia2.htm">psychedelia</a>, and <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/currentstudents/undergraduates/modules/fictionnownarrativemediaandtheoryinthe21stcentury/manifestly_haraway_----_a_cyborg_manifesto_science_technology_and_socialist-feminism_in_the_....pdf">feminist</a> <a href="https://haenfler.sites.grinnell.edu/afrofuturism/">afrofuturism</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                having graduated from the <a href="https://bass.utdallas.edu/">bass school of arts, humanities, and technology</a>, i draw on an academic background in sociology, design, and media history to guide my methodological approach.
                i also spent ten years employed as a freelance videographer and several more as a courier, granting me occupational familiarity with light and movement.
                synthesizing the abovementioned influences into an interdisciplinary workflow, i apply <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~mshanks/MichaelShanks/files/509554.pdf">stanford design thinking</a>, <a href="https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/our-resources/the-double-diamond/">the double diamond framework</a>, and <a href="https://www.lafilm.edu/blog/5-stages-of-indie-film-production/">filmmaking phasing</a>, among other relevant insights.
                furthermore, my lived experience as a proletarian black queer immigrant informs my thematic and aesthetic sensibilities alike.

                lastly, since i first began producing music and street performing at 16, <a href="https://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/legacy/mit5/papers/SamplingRealLife-Lankford.pdf">sampling</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8042224/">busking</a> have been indispensable aspects of my practice.
                faced with epochal levels of wealth inequality and political disenfranchisement, members of market-dominated societies stand to gain immeasurably from these techniques.
                both make necessary resources sustainably accessible by offering alternative means of distributing them beyond those legitimized by the state and capital.
                in turn, they aid in protecting the commons, fertile ground wherein every reality germinates like a seed.
                there, the me who used rubber bands as string instruments and modeled jetpacks out of styrofoam duct-taped to pringles cans is emancipated from lack.
