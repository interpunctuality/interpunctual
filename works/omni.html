            <p class="description">
                during my tenure as a student at the university of texas at dallas, 15 of my classmates and i had the life-changing opportunity to participate in <a href="https://bass.utdallas.edu/news/omni-dallas-hotel-illuminates-skyline-with-student-crafted-animations/">a pixel mapping art exhibit</a> showcased on the side of <a href="https://www.visitdallas.com/directory/omni-dallas-hotel/">one of the most recognizable buildings in my hometown's skyline</a>, allowing us to reach <a href="http://www.anewdallas.com/traffic.html">approximately 65,000 people</a> each with our pieces.
                the conceptual premise underlying this composition is twofold.
                firstly, the omni is a hotel and, as such, a hub for motion and travel.
                secondly, its name has etymological roots in the latin word for "all." 
                consequently, i wanted to express this thematic content in a similarly dualistic way and elected to do so through two visual elements: the agitated clouds that cycle through all perceptible colors in the background and a gyroscope, an object capable of freely rotating in any direction, in the foreground.

            <p class="description"> 
                to create the spinning centerpiece, i generated a sphere and three toruses using java code, then queried ai to calculate the values necessary to animate it. 
                the churning backdrop is a fabrication made possible by layering and blending several instances of video recorded at a festival on top of each other until they became unidentifiable, complex noise, then applying a hue-changing filter to the resulting mixture. 
                adobe after effects allowed me to import all of my digital assets into a single workspace, including a photoshop preview template provided by professor scott that offered insight into how my work would translate to the building itself. 
                in this environment, i manipulated various properties of the rotary device - such as its scale, position, and opacity - to make the luminous choreography more dynamic.
