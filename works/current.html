                <a href="/Users/nibiru/web dev/nibiru fae/media/current/chateau-reference.pdf">a 2022 journal article</a>, dr. lucie chateau describes the process by which some exploited workers "willfully degrade their images to make a commentary on their own act of objectification." in this case, the "purposefully-poor image" in question is of decaying human remains covered in increasingly worthless cash, emphasizing the loss of meaning and agency experienced by its producer(s) under global capitalist hegemony. i contributed to this movement of creative praxis by digitizing and further degrading the picture.

                <a href="https://glitchyimage.com/">https://glitchyimage.com/</a> and adobe photoshop. after processing it using the former, i dropped the distorted png file into the latter and used it to add noise, contrast, and saturation to the final deliverable. finally, i blended two separately edited instances of the photo and layered zeros over all other visible integers to emphasize the themes of depreciation and absurdity.
